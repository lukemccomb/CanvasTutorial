# HTML5 Canvas Tutorial

HTML5 Canvas is a super-cool tool for drawing, animating, making games, and more. No Gems, no libraries, just straight up HTML and JavaScript to get things done. Keep your trusty [cheat sheet](http://cheatsheetworld.com/programming/html5-canvas-cheat-sheet/) nearby and let's get started with the setup:

```
<html>
    <head>

    </head>

    <body>
        <canvas id="my-canvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
        <script src="canvas.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

You may wish to add a CSS border around your canvas to clearly see it. In your javascript file, 
hook up a variable to the context of the canvas to begin drawing. We're going to use the "2d" context, 
though there is an experimental "webgl" context that is only on browsers running WebGL. 

```
var canvas = document.getElementById('my-canvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```
## Line
Now we're ready to begin drawing our first line! Paths all have a beginning, movement, and an end. 
They also have some options that must be set before drawing a line on the path. 
This includes things like a width, color, and style for a path end. In the javascript file continue writing: 

```
ctx.lineWidth = 10;
ctx.strokeStyle = "#ff0000";
ctx.lineCap = 'round';
```

`lineWidth` sets the width, `strokeStyle` is the color, and `lineCap` sets the line end styling 
(`round`, `square`, and `butt` are the `lineCap` options). Now we will start the path at a point,
 move to a new point, and stroke on the line we just made. Continue writing:

```
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(0, 0);
ctx.lineTo(250, 400);
ctx.stroke();
```

Yay a line! First `beginPath()` starts a new path. The starting location is defined with `moveTo(x,y)`. 
**It is important to note that y increases as you go down the page while x increases from left to right.** 
`lineTo(x,y)` sets the way we draw a line and to which location we will draw. Finally we stroke the line we just set.
   
Next let us draw a second line of another color. To accomplish this, set a new stroke style and begin a new path in your 
brand new color. We'll draw a V back up to the top with a blue line (afterwards, play around with the `lineCap` property 
to see how they look with this setup)

```
ctx.strokeStyle = '#0000ff';
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(250, 400);
ctx.lineTo(500, 0);
ctx.stroke();
```

Great! Two separate lines- but I what if I draw one line with an angle in it, not two separate lines? 
I'll need that to make the angle look nice. Let us all remember Bob Ross and put a happy little angle in our line. Continue writing:

```
ctx.strokeStyle = '#00ff00';
ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(150,150);
ctx.lineTo(250,50);
ctx.lineTo(350,150);
ctx.lineJoin = 'round';
ctx.stroke();
```

Here we see two consecutive `lineTo(x,y)` to draw our angle. Next is the new `lineJoin` property which accepts `'round'`,
 `'miter'`, and `'bevel'`. Test each to see how they look then we'll move on.

## Arc

We're going to look at circular arcs. The `arc` method draws portions of a circle- let us draw one at the center of canvas. 
It takes a [center x,y coordinate, a radius, a start and end angle, and a stroke direction]
(http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/demos/tutorials/html5-canvas-arcs/html5-canvas-arcs-diagram.png). 
Since this is javascript, let us start passing variables into our method arguments to see what *that* looks like.

```
var x = canvas.width / 2;
var y = canvas.height / 2;
var radius = 75;
var startAngle = 1.1 * Math.PI;
var endAngle = 0.9 * Math.PI;
var counterClockwise = false;

ctx.lineWidth = 25;
ctx.strokeStyle = "red";
ctx.lineCap = "round";

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, counterClockwise);
ctx.stroke();
```

Notice how we can get the center of the canvas via `canvas.width` and `canvas.height`, and that the start and end angles are all based on 
[radians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian). Radians measure angles starting at 0 and up to 2Ï€, while degrees measure from 0 to 360. I
f you want a perfect circle, pass `0` and `2*Math.PI` for your start and end angles.  
Change the multiplier for start and end angles between 0 and 2 to see the effect on the arc, playing with the direction boolean as you go.

## Quadratic Curve

I don't want some circley shaped ne'er-do-well plebeian curve. I want to bend it any which way I want- so I'll need it to 
[take a beginning point, a control point, and an end point](http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/demos/tutorials/html5-canvas-quadratic-curves/html5-canvas-quadratic-curves-diagram.png) 
to define my very own quadratic curve.
 
```
var contextX = 240;
var contextY = 50;
var controlX = 275;
var controlY = 220;
var endX = 310;
var endY = 50;

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(contextX, contextY);
ctx.quadraticCurveTo(controlX, controlY, endX, endY);

ctx.lineWidth = 25;
ctx.strokeStyle = 'purple';
ctx.lineCap = 'round';
ctx.stroke();
```

 Play around with the points to see how they work, then draw your own curve coming out of the first- don't forget to set the `lineJoin`.
 
## Bezier Curve

A single control point is alright. Pretty cool I guess. Two is where it is at, and that is precisely what `bezierCurveTo` takes- 
[two control point coordinates and an ending point](http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/demos/tutorials/html5-canvas-bezier-curves/html5-canvas-bezier-curves-diagram.png). 
This enables more nuanced curves with bubbles and contractions all over. 
 
```
var contextX = 240;
var contextY = 50;
var controlOneX = 75;
var controlOneY = 220;
var controlTwoX = 475;
var controlTwoY = 420;
var endX = 310;
var endY = 25;

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(contextX, contextY);
ctx.bezierCurveTo(controlOneX, controlOneY, controlTwoX, controlTwoY, endX, endY);

ctx.lineWidth = 25;
ctx.strokeStyle = '#cccccc';  
ctx.lineCap = 'round';
ctx.stroke();
```

Try to use some bezier curves to create a familiar shape, like a tooth or an eye or a ping pong paddle.

## Fills, Rects[,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) and Other Shapes

Just as you can stroke a path, you can fill one too. I will demonstrate with a new method `rect(x, y, width, height)` that makes rectangles if given a starting coordinate, width, and height. Note that `fillStyle` sets a color while `fill()` does the coloring.

```
var x = 50;
var y = 50;
var width = 200;
var height = 100;

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.rect(x, y, width, height);
ctx.fillStyle = 'orange';
ctx.fill();
ctx.lineWidth = 7;
ctx.strokeStyle = 'yellow';
ctx.stroke();
```

### closePath()

How do you fill a funny shaped path? `closePath()` to the rescue! This method takes wherever your current context is located and draws a line to the very first context of your path. Here an arc is closed to form a semicircle:

```
var x = 100;
var y = 100;
var radius = 70;
var startAngle = Math.PI/2.5;

ctx.lineWidth = 5;
ctx.fillStyle = 'pink';
ctx.strokeStyle = '#550000';

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, startAngle + Math.PI, false);
ctx.closePath();
ctx.fill();
ctx.stroke();
```

Let's show an example with a bezier curve connected to a quadratic curve that is closed shut and filled. Note the final context point of 50,75 drawing a vertical 25px line to the starting context point 50,50.

```
ctx.lineWidth = 30;
ctx.lineCap = 'round';
ctx.lineJoin = 'round';
ctx.strokeStyle = 'blue';
ctx.fillStyle = 'lightblue';

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(50,50);
ctx.bezierCurveTo(400,200,150,150,460,30);
ctx.quadraticCurveTo(250,450,50,75);
ctx.closePath();
ctx.stroke();
ctx.fill();
```

Once you think you grasp how it works, create your own shape, anything you want to draw, then close and fill it.

## Understanding fillStyle to unlock Patterns, Gradients

'Why wouldn't you just give fillStyle a name like fillColor or something?' said me when I first used it. We don't because it can take variables which describe gradients or patterns, too. Let us see a gradient variable in action- first set a variable `grd` using the `createLinearGradient` context method. Pass two coordinates as arguments defining the line over which the gradient will change color. Set the colors with `addColorStop`, and assign your `fillStyle` to the `grd` variable.

```
ctx.rect(50, 50, 400, 400);

var grd = ctx.createLinearGradient(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    grd.addColorStop(0, 'yellow');
    grd.addColorStop(1, 'red');
ctx.fillStyle = grd;
ctx.fill();
```

Pass different coordinate arguments for your `createLinearGradient` to change the direction of the gradient, then see what happens when you change that peculiar first number argument for the two `addColorStop`. Then check out what happens when you use `createRadialGradient(250, 250, 20, 250, 250, 300);` instead of the linear gradient context method (the arguments are two circles, *x*, *y*, *radius*, try to change the starting x coordinate of the second circle to 0).
 
### Pattern

You can also set patterns by loading an image prototype and using the context method `createPattern` to set your `fillStyle`.

```
var imageObject = new Image();
imageObject.onload = function() {
  var pattern = ctx.createPattern(imageObject, 'repeat');

  ctx.rect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  ctx.fillStyle = pattern;
  ctx.fill();
};
imageObject.src = 'http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-10uYQ232GmA/VB2cCRa0pDI/AAAAAAAAGgw/m9nRdE1d-Rg/s1600/checkerboard-tile-pattern.jpg';
```

`onload` is a useful method on Image prototypes as it allows you to render images only after they properly load. Don't forget to set your image sources!


## Simple animation

You can animate canvas elements in a variety of ways- I'm going to show you a simple way involving `setInterval(function, speed)`. Every time the function in our setInterval runs we will clear the drawing space, move some coordinates around, and redraw. Start by setting all our variables for the line- for now let us draw a vertical line that moves to the right. `dx` sets the rate of change.
 
```
var canvas = document.getElementById('my-canvas');
var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

ctx.lineWidth = 5;
ctx.strokeStyle = "#ff00ff";
ctx.lineCap = 'round';

var startX = 50;
var startY = 50;

var endX = 50;
var endY = 150;

var dx = 2;
```
 
Next we will set our initialize function which calls all once-only functions for the animation. Inside we put the setInterval which calls our `drawCanvas` function. The first step to animation is clearing the current frame out for the next one. `clearRect` accomplishes this feat by erasing everything drawn inside it.

```
var init = function(){
  setInterval(drawCanvas, 20)
};

var drawCanvas = function(){
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)
};

init()
```

We still need to draw our line on the canvas. Put the actual line drawing into our `drawCanvas` function after the `clearRect` call:
 
 ```
var drawCanvas = function(){
 ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
 
 ctx.beginPath();
 ctx.moveTo(startX,startY);
 ctx.lineTo(endX, endY);
 ctx.stroke();
};
```

This is close, however we've got no movement on the screen yet. Since we are moving the object from left to right, we have to ensure that our X variables are increasing at our defined speed. Finish the `drawCanvas` method by increasing our X variables by `dx` on every frame:

```
var drawCanvas = function(){
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(startX,startY);
  ctx.lineTo(endX, endY);
  ctx.stroke();
  
  startX += dx;
  endX += dx;
};
```

You've made a cartoon! Ok so this example isn't the most impressive, however you have the skills now to animate absolutely any variable for any of the canvas tools available to you. So many possibilities! 

Your training is complete, but this is just the first step. You will find some challenges below to test your might and grow your skills- complete them to get 15 Internet Points (Internet Points on non-redeemable and hold no cash value, and frankly serve no purpose. BUT YOU MUST HAVE THEM).

# Challenges

### Draw a single line that moves out at a specific angle

Remember radians? Yeah you're gonna need those suckers again. I want my line to start at the center of the canvas and have a ~~hypotenuse~~ length of 175, and an angle of Ï€/6. Deep within your Junior High mathematics memory should stir an ancient beast, [SohCahToa](http://www.mathwords.com/s/sohcahtoa.htm). Also remember that JavaScript has `Math.cos(angle)` and `Math.sin(angle)` which totally take radians. Remember that everything needs to be a float to calculate properly, and that we're moving OUT from the center point. *I have just been informed that Ï€/6 does not appear to draw the same angle shown [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian#mediaviewer/File:Degree-Radian_Conversion.svg) but that is as intended. Are you bad enough to ~~save the president?~~ figure out why?)*

### Animate a single line to spin in a circle

Let us take the line you just made and spin it like we're playing Twister. Create a setup for the line to animate and adjust only the angle for each frame of animation. It should spin without ending and maintain a constant speed.
  
### Acceleration is just the rate of a rate

"In this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics!" - *Homer*. That spinner needs to slow down. Either on page refresh or when you click the spinner, I expect it to start at a random angle with a start speed that randomly varies in a range. The spinner's speed should gradually go down until it hits zero.

### Lines in a timely fashion

Anybody remember those like, time tracker things that are circular and sort of tell the time but with arrows pointing between numbers? Let's make our line make the second hand of one of those. Hint: if 2Ï€ is one full rotation around the circle, I think **2Ï€ * 1/60** will give you the angle change after one second.

### Lines in a timely fashion - Hard Mode

Draw a minute, hour, and second hand of the clock (it is called a clock, I looked it up) based on the current time at page load.

### Lines in a timely fashion - Insanity Mode

Animate the clock to always display the current time properly, morning or afternoon. Give it a lovely styling.
  
### Lines in a timely fashion - Are you kidding me this could go on my resume at this point Mode

Using three separate canvases, draw three animated clocks which represent the current time in three different time zones- allow your users to pick the timezone via a drop down selector.
